Subject: [PATCH 1/2] CHROMIUM: PM / sleep: try to runtime suspend for direct
 complete

This tries to runtime suspend devices that are still active for direct
complete. This is for cases such as autosuspend delays which leaves devices
able to runtime suspend but still active. It's beneficial in this case to
runtime suspend the device to take advantage of direct complete when
possible.

TEST=suspend_stress_test on glados with usb drive plugged in
